        LEEYANARAHMAN® started in 2012. Two friends, while still studying in their university, had a vision: to share their sense of style by turning everyday essential items into elegant design pieces with an unyielding standard of quality and creativity. LEEYANARAHMAN® is led by its co-founders, Mr Muhammad Hafiz and Mrs Nur Liyana, who formed the fast-growing company while still in their 20’s, after four years of operating the company underground. We are a young team with enormous love for fashion and tradition, who dares to think big and isn’t afraid to be different. That is why we aim at designing and producing stunning, functional, and affordable contemporary modest ready-to-wear apparels that elevate confidence of the users.

<h1>OUR HISTORY</h1>
<style>
    .justified-text {
        text-align: justify;
    }
</style>

<p class="justified-text"></p>
LEEYANARAHMAN® Empire Sdn Bhd is founded by two young visionary entrepreneurs; Mr. Muhammad Hafiz bin Dato’ Abd Hamid and Mrs. Nur Liyana binti Abdul Rahman. Both of them hold a Bachelor Degree in Business Administration from Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM).

<p class="justified-text"></p>
While entrepreneurship among the young generation was deterred by risk-averseness and pessimism, for Mr. Hafiz and Mrs. Nur Liyana, it was always mission possible. In a job market characterized by intense competition and industrial revolution 4.0, they knew they had to make a change, not only for themselves, but for all youth.

<p class="justified-text"></p>
Their status as students in UiTM did not hold them back from starting a business. On the sacred date of December 31st, 2012, they co-founded LEEYANARAHMAN® Collection as their first brainchild. The business, which operated primarily online, thrive by riding the e-commerce wave hence the founders took a leap of faith and registered a “Sendirian Berhad” company in 2016; henceforth carries the name of LEEYANARAHMAN® EMPIRE Sdn Bhd.

<p class="justified-text"></p>
LEEYANARAHMAN® boutique is erected in the same year at a five-storey building located in Bandar Baru Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia, carrying various products ranging from women’s to kids and men’s wear. The company prevails to this date with the strength of approximately 20 employees. The founders’ unwavering determination and “can do” attitude have inspired millions of youngsters and put them on the pedestal as exemplary young entrepreneurs and leaders.
